# Development Performance Crisis - Implementation Plan

## üö® **CRITICAL PRIORITY: Development Performance Crisis**

**Issue**: Real developers reporting "unacceptable" 30+ second compilation times  
**Impact**: Blocking Leptos adoption  
**Timeline**: Next 2 weeks (Emergency response)

## üéØ **Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)**

### Week 1: Emergency Performance Analysis & Quick Wins

#### Day 1-2: Performance Analysis
- [ ] **Benchmark current compilation times** across different project sizes
- [ ] **Identify major bottlenecks** in the compilation pipeline
- [ ] **Profile cargo-leptos** build process
- [ ] **Document performance pain points** with specific examples

#### Day 3-4: Quick Wins Implementation
- [ ] **Implement `cargo leptos dev --fast`** command
- [ ] **Add development-mode optimizations**:
  - Reduced optimization levels
  - Parallel compilation
  - Smart dependency caching
  - Skip unnecessary checks
- [ ] **Integrate FastDevMode** from leptos_dev_performance

#### Day 5-7: Hot-Reload Reliability
- [ ] **Fix hot-reload reliability issues**
- [ ] **Implement debounced file watching**
- [ ] **Add error recovery mechanisms**
- [ ] **Test across different file types and changes**

### Week 2: Community Communication & Validation

#### Day 8-10: Community Communication
- [ ] **Announce performance improvements** timeline
- [ ] **Create performance comparison** benchmarks
- [ ] **Document new `--fast` mode** usage
- [ ] **Gather community feedback** on pain points

#### Day 11-14: Validation & Iteration
- [ ] **Test with real community projects**
- [ ] **Measure performance improvements**
- [ ] **Iterate based on feedback**
- [ ] **Prepare for broader rollout**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### 1. `cargo leptos dev --fast` Command

**Goal**: Reduce compilation time by 50-70% for development

**Implementation**:
```rust
// In cargo-leptos
#[derive(Parser)]
struct DevCommand {
    #[arg(long)]
    fast: bool,
    // ... other options
}

impl DevCommand {
    fn run(&self) -> Result<()> {
        if self.fast {
            FastDevMode::new()?.run_fast_dev()?;
        } else {
            // Normal development mode
        }
    }
}
```

**Fast Mode Optimizations**:
- `opt-level = 0` (no optimization)
- `debug = true` (faster compilation)
- `incremental = true` (incremental compilation)
- `codegen-units = 16` (parallel codegen)
- Skip type checking for unchanged files
- Use cached dependencies when possible

### 2. Hot-Reload Reliability Improvements

**Current Issues**:
- File watching fails on some systems
- Multiple rapid changes cause conflicts
- Error recovery is poor
- No debouncing of changes

**Solutions**:
```rust
// Enhanced hot-reload with reliability
impl HotReloadManager {
    fn new_with_reliability() -> Self {
        Self {
            debounce_duration: Duration::from_millis(300),
            max_retries: 3,
            error_recovery: true,
            // ... other reliability features
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring Dashboard

**Goal**: Real-time visibility into build performance

**Features**:
- Build time tracking
- Bottleneck identification
- Performance trend analysis
- Optimization recommendations

## üìä **Success Metrics**

### Primary Targets (2-week goal):
- **Compilation time**: 30s ‚Üí <10s (67% improvement)
- **Hot-reload reliability**: 60% ‚Üí 90% success rate
- **Developer satisfaction**: Measurable improvement in feedback

### Measurement Approach:
- **Benchmark suite**: Standard project sizes (small, medium, large)
- **Real-world testing**: Community project compilation times
- **User feedback**: Discord/issue tracker sentiment analysis

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### Fast Development Mode Configuration

```toml
# Cargo.toml for fast development
[profile.dev-fast]
inherits = "dev"
opt-level = 0
debug = true
incremental = true
codegen-units = 16
lto = false
panic = "abort"

# Skip expensive checks
[profile.dev-fast.package."*"]
opt-level = 0
```

### Incremental Compilation Strategy

```rust
impl IncrementalCompiler {
    fn should_recompile(&self, file: &Path) -> bool {
        // Check file hash
        // Check dependency changes
        // Check compilation cache
        // Return true only if necessary
    }
    
    fn compile_incremental(&self, changed_files: &[PathBuf]) -> Result<()> {
        // Only compile changed files and dependencies
        // Use cached results for unchanged files
        // Parallel compilation where possible
    }
}
```

### Hot-Reload Reliability Features

```rust
impl HotReloadManager {
    fn watch_with_debounce(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        // Debounce rapid file changes
        // Retry failed operations
        // Graceful error recovery
        // Validate changes before applying
    }
}
```

## üöÄ **Rollout Strategy**

### Phase 1: Beta Testing (Week 1)
- **Target**: Core contributors and early adopters
- **Scope**: `cargo leptos dev --fast` command
- **Feedback**: Daily check-ins and performance reports

### Phase 2: Community Preview (Week 2)
- **Target**: Active community members
- **Scope**: Full performance improvements
- **Feedback**: Structured feedback collection

### Phase 3: General Availability (Week 3+)
- **Target**: All Leptos users
- **Scope**: Default fast mode for development
- **Documentation**: Complete usage guides

## üìà **Expected Impact**

### Immediate (2 weeks):
- **50-70% faster** development compilation
- **90%+ reliable** hot-reload
- **Significantly improved** developer experience

### Medium-term (1 month):
- **Increased adoption** due to better DX
- **Reduced support** questions about performance
- **Positive community** sentiment

### Long-term (3 months):
- **Competitive advantage** over other frameworks
- **Foundation** for advanced performance features
- **Sustainable development** workflow

## üîç **Risk Mitigation**

### Technical Risks:
- **Breaking changes**: Maintain backward compatibility
- **Performance regressions**: Comprehensive testing
- **Complexity**: Keep fast mode simple and reliable

### Community Risks:
- **Expectation management**: Clear communication about improvements
- **Migration support**: Help existing projects adopt fast mode
- **Documentation**: Keep guides updated and clear

## üìö **Documentation Plan**

### Immediate (Week 1):
- [ ] Performance improvement announcement
- [ ] `--fast` mode usage guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting performance issues

### Short-term (Week 2):
- [ ] Performance benchmarking guide
- [ ] Hot-reload best practices
- [ ] Performance optimization tips

### Long-term (Month 1):

## üéØ **Next Steps After This Phase**

Once the development performance crisis is resolved, the roadmap continues with:

1. **Month 2**: Feature Flag Elimination
2. **Month 3**: Error Message Enhancement
3. **Month 4**: Unified Signal API

This performance work provides the foundation for all subsequent improvements by ensuring developers can iterate quickly and efficiently.
