# Development Performance and Hot Reload Issues

**Issue ID**: LEPTOS-2024-006  
**Severity**: High  
**Category**: Developer Experience  
**Status**: Open  
**Created**: 2024-09-08  
**Updated**: 2024-09-08  

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Developers experience 30+ second compilation times during development, broken hot-reloading functionality, and slow development iteration cycles that make Leptos development significantly slower than competing frameworks.

### Impact Assessment
- **Developer Impact**: ðŸ”´ **High** - Unacceptable development iteration speed, broken workflow
- **Adoption Impact**: ðŸ”´ **Critical** - Developers abandon framework due to slow development cycle
- **Maintenance Impact**: ðŸŸ¡ **Medium** - Complex hot-reload system maintenance burden
- **Performance Impact**: âšª **None** - Development-time only issue

### Evidence

**GitHub Issues from 2024**:
```bash
# Real developer feedback from GitHub discussions
"everytime I make a change I have to wait approx. 30 seconds to recompile the wasm 
(cargo leptos watch). this is unacceptable imo"

# Hot-reload problems:
"Error: expected identifier, found keyword"
"Reload internal error: sending css reload but no css file is set"
"totally wrong children are being replaced"
"removing children does not work properly"
```

**Technical Issues**:
- **Compilation Speed**: 30+ seconds for WASM recompilation on changes
- **Hot-Reload Failures**: Syntax errors, internal errors, incorrect DOM updates
- **Dual-Target Compilation**: Building for both native and WASM targets
- **Type System Impact**: Leptos 0.7+ type system changes slow compilation

**Community Impact**:
- Developers switching to JS frameworks for faster iteration
- "Unacceptable" development experience quoted directly
- Significant barrier to productive development workflow

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Analysis
- **Dual Compilation**: Building for both server (native) and client (WASM) targets
- **Type System Complexity**: Heavy type system usage in 0.7+ impacts compile times
- **Hot-Reload Architecture**: Complex macro-based system prone to failures
- **WASM Compilation**: Inherently slower than native compilation

### Design Analysis
- **No Incremental Compilation**: Full recompilation on changes
- **Monolithic Build**: No granular compilation of changed components
- **Hot-Reload Complexity**: Macro-based hot-reload is brittle and error-prone
- **Missing Optimization**: No development-specific optimizations

## Proposed Solution

### Overview
Implement development-mode optimizations including incremental compilation, improved hot-reload architecture, and development-specific build modes that prioritize iteration speed over production optimization.

### Technical Approach

**1. Development Build Modes**
```bash
# Proposed: Fast development mode
cargo leptos dev --fast          # Optimized for iteration speed
cargo leptos dev --hot-reload    # Existing hot-reload
cargo leptos dev --production    # Full optimization (current default)
```

**2. Incremental Compilation Strategy**
```rust
// Proposed: Component-level compilation
[package.metadata.leptos]
dev_mode = "incremental"
component_cache = true
wasm_optimization = "dev" # Minimal optimization in dev
```

**3. Improved Hot-Reload Architecture**
```rust
// Proposed: Reliable hot-reload system
#[component]
#[hot_reload] // Opt-in for components that support hot-reload
pub fn MyComponent() -> impl IntoView {
    // Hot-reload friendly component
}
```

**4. Development Performance Optimizations**
```toml
# Proposed: Development profile
[profile.dev-fast]
inherits = "dev"
opt-level = 0
debug = false
incremental = true
codegen-units = 256  # Faster parallel compilation
```

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Vite-style Dev Server**: Separate dev server with module replacement - Complex
2. **Native-only Development**: Skip WASM in development - Breaks parity
3. **JIT Compilation**: Runtime compilation for development - Major architecture change

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (4 weeks)
- [ ] Analyze current compilation bottlenecks
- [ ] Design incremental compilation strategy
- [ ] Create development-specific build profiles
- [ ] Basic hot-reload reliability improvements

### Phase 2: Implementation (8 weeks)
- [ ] Implement fast development mode
- [ ] Incremental WASM compilation
- [ ] Improved hot-reload architecture
- [ ] Component-level caching system

### Phase 3: Optimization (4 weeks)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and tuning
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Documentation and guides
- [ ] Community testing and feedback

### Success Criteria
- Development compilation time: 30s â†’ <5s (83% improvement)
- Hot-reload success rate: 60% â†’ 95%
- Development iteration speed competitive with JS frameworks
- No regression in production build quality

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
- **Complexity**: Additional build modes increase system complexity
- **Parity Issues**: Development and production builds may diverge
- **Cache Invalidation**: Incremental compilation cache management

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Extensive testing across development/production parity
- Clear cache invalidation strategies
- Fallback to full compilation when needed

### Breaking Changes
ðŸŸ¢ **Minimal Breaking Changes**
- New features are opt-in
- Existing workflows continue to work
- Performance improvements only

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Compilation performance benchmarks
- Hot-reload reliability tests
- Cache invalidation correctness

### Integration Tests
- Full development workflow testing
- Cross-platform compilation speed
- Production build parity validation

### Performance Tests
- Compilation time benchmarks
- Memory usage during development
- Hot-reload response time measurement

### User Acceptance Tests
- Developer workflow experience testing
- Iteration speed measurements
- Hot-reload reliability in real applications

## Documentation Requirements

### API Documentation
- Development mode configuration
- Hot-reload best practices
- Performance optimization guide

### User Guides
- "Fast Development Setup" guide
- Hot-reload troubleshooting
- Performance optimization strategies

### Migration Guides
- None required (additive improvements)

## Community Impact

### Backward Compatibility
âœ… **Full Compatibility** - Only adds new capabilities

### Learning Curve
ðŸ“ˆ **Significant Improvement** - Faster development iteration encourages experimentation

### Ecosystem Impact
ðŸŽ¯ **Critical** - Essential for competitive developer experience
