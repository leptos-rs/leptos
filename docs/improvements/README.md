# Leptos Framework Improvements

This directory contains documented improvements and defects identified for the Leptos web framework, focusing on developer experience and ease of website development.

## Overview

Based on comprehensive analysis of the framework's developer experience, these issues represent the primary barriers to mainstream adoption and areas where improvements would have the highest impact on developer productivity.

## Issue Categories

### ðŸ”´ Critical Priority (P0) - Adoption Blockers
Issues that prevent developers from successfully getting started with the framework.

### ðŸŸ¡ High Priority (P1) - Experience Friction  
Issues that create significant friction in daily development workflow.

### ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority (P2) - Quality of Life
Issues that would improve developer satisfaction but don't block usage.

## Documented Issues

### Critical Priority (P0)
- **[LEPTOS-2024-001](./LEPTOS-2024-001-project-setup-complexity.md)** - Project Setup Complexity
  - *Problem*: 90+ line Cargo.toml configuration required for basic full-stack apps
  - *Impact*: Primary barrier to framework adoption - developers abandon during setup
  - *Solution*: `leptos init` command with intelligent project scaffolding

- **[LEPTOS-2024-002](./LEPTOS-2024-002-feature-flag-confusion.md)** - Feature Flag Mental Overhead
  - *Problem*: Complex feature flag system (`csr`/`ssr`/`hydrate`) causes silent failures
  - *Impact*: Misconfiguration leads to broken deployments and difficult debugging
  - *Solution*: Automatic feature detection with build mode declarations

### High Priority (P1)
- **[LEPTOS-2024-003](./LEPTOS-2024-003-signal-api-complexity.md)** - Reactive System Learning Curve
  - *Problem*: Multiple signal types create analysis paralysis for beginners
  - *Impact*: Steep learning curve intimidates new developers
  - *Solution*: Unified `signal()` API with progressive disclosure

- **[LEPTOS-2024-005](./LEPTOS-2024-005-error-messages.md)** - Framework Error Messages
  - *Problem*: Cryptic compiler errors don't provide actionable guidance
  - *Impact*: Frustrating debugging experience, high support burden
  - *Solution*: Framework-aware error detection with actionable suggestions

### Medium Priority (P2)  
- **[LEPTOS-2024-004](./LEPTOS-2024-004-server-function-boilerplate.md)** - Server Function Boilerplate
  - *Problem*: Repetitive patterns for database access and error handling
  - *Impact*: Verbose code and potential inconsistencies across applications
  - *Solution*: Database-aware helpers and context injection improvements

## Implementation Roadmap

See **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** for the complete implementation timeline and strategic approach.

### Phase 1 (Q4 2024): Foundation
Focus on eliminating primary adoption barriers through project setup automation and feature flag elimination.

### Phase 2 (Q1 2025): API Refinement  
Reduce learning curve through unified APIs and better developer tooling.

### Phase 3 (Q2 2025): Ecosystem Maturity
Build comprehensive ecosystem with components, styling, and deployment tools.

## Success Metrics

**Short-term Goals** (6 months):
- Reduce new project setup time from 30+ minutes to <5 minutes
- Decrease setup-related support questions by 60%
- Increase tutorial completion rate from 40% to 80%

**Long-term Goals** (12 months):
- 3x increase in framework adoption
- 50% reduction in common bug reports  
- Developer satisfaction score >8/10

## Contributing to Improvements

### Issue Template
Use **[ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)** to document new framework improvements.

### Process
1. **Identify Problem**: Analyze developer pain points with evidence
2. **Document Issue**: Use standard template with impact assessment
3. **Design Solution**: Technical approach with alternatives considered
4. **Plan Implementation**: Phased approach with success criteria
5. **Risk Assessment**: Breaking changes, migration paths, testing strategy

### Review Process
- Issues reviewed monthly for priority and feasibility
- Community feedback incorporated through RFC process
- Implementation coordinated with core maintainers

## Impact Analysis

### Developer Experience Improvements
- **Setup Time**: 30 min â†’ <5 min (83% reduction)
- **Learning Curve**: Multiple concepts â†’ Single entry points
