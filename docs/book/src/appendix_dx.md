## Autocompletion inside `#[component]` and `#[server]`

Because of the nature of macros (they can expand from anything to anything, but only if the input is exactly correct at that instant) it can be hard for rust-analyzer to do proper autocompletion and other support.

But you can tell rust-analyzer to ignore certain proc macros. For `#[component]` and `#[server]` especially, which annotate function bodies but don't actually transform anything inside the body of your function, this can be really helpful.

Note that this means that rust-analyzer doesn't know about your component props, which may generate its own set of errors or warnings in the IDE.

VSCode `settings.json`:

```json
"rust-analyzer.procMacro.ignored": {
	"leptos_macro": [
		"server",
		"component"
	],
}
```

neovim with lspconfig:

```lua
require('lspconfig').rust_analyzer.setup {
  -- Other Configs ...
  settings = {
    ["rust-analyzer"] = {
      -- Other Settings ...
      procMacro = {
        ignored = {
            leptos_macro = {
                "server",
                "component",
            },
        },
      },
    },
  }
}
```

Helix, in `.helix/languages.toml`:

```toml
[[language]]
name = "rust"
config = { procMacro = {ignored = {leptos_macro = ["component"]}}}
```
