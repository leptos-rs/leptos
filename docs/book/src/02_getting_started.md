# Getting Started

There are two basic paths to getting started with Leptos:
1. Client-side rendering with [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)
2. Full-stack rendering with [`cargo-leptos`](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos)

For the early examples, it will be easiest to begin with Trunk. We’ll introduce
`cargo-leptos` a little later in this series.


If you don’t already have it installed, you can install Trunk by running

```bash
cargo install trunk
```

Create a basic Rust binary project

```bash
cargo init leptos-tutorial
```

`cd` into your new `leptos-tutorial` project and add `leptos` as a dependency 
```bash
cargo add leptos
```

Create a simple `index.html` in the root of the `leptos-tutorial` directory
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

And add a simple “Hello, world!” to your `main.rs`
```rust 
use leptos::*;

fn main() {
    mount_to_body(|_cx| view! { cx,  <p>"Hello, world!"</p> })
}
```

Now run `trunk serve --open`. Trunk should automatically compile your app and 
open it in your default browser. If you make edits to `main.rs`, Trunk will 
recompile your source code and live-reload the page.
