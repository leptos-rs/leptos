```rust
// Support for non-Clone types
let data = signal::rc(Rc::new(ComplexData::new()));
let shared = signal::arc(Arc::new(SharedData::new()));
let weak = signal::weak(Weak::new());
```

// Custom dependency tracking
let custom = signal::custom(|| {
    track_dependency(&a);
    track_dependency(&b);
    compute_result()
});
