//! Isomorphic web applications that run on the server to render HTML, then add interactivity in
//! the client, need to accomplish two tasks:
//! 1. Send HTML from the server, so that the client can "hydrate" it in the browser by adding
//!    event listeners and setting up other interactivity.
//! 2. Send data that was loaded on the server to the client, so that the client "hydrates" with
//!    the same data with which the server rendered HTML.
//!
//! This crate helps with the second part of this process. It provides a [`SharedContext`] type
//! that allows you to store data on the server, and then extract the same data in the client.
