/// Derives a reactive slice of an [`RwSignal`](crate::RwSignal).
///
/// Slices have the same guarantees as [`Memo`s](crate::Memo):
/// they only emit their value when it has actually been changed.
///
/// Slices need a getter and a setter, and you must make sure that
/// the setter and getter only touch their respective field and nothing else.
/// They optimally should not have any side effects.
///
/// You can use slices whenever you want to react to only parts
/// of a bigger signal. The prime example would be state management,
/// where you want all state variables grouped together, but also need
/// fine-grained signals for each or some of these variables.
/// In the example below, setting an auth token will only trigger
/// the token signal, but none of the other derived signals.
