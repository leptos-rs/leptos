# Leptos Counters Example

This example showcases a basic leptos app with many counters. It is a good example of how to setup a basic reactive app with signals and effects, and how to interact with browser events.

## Client Side Rendering

To run it as a client-side app, you can issue `trunk serve --open` in the root. This will build the entire app into one CSR bundle.
