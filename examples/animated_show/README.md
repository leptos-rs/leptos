# Animated Show Example

This is a very simple example of the `<AnimatedShow>` component.

The `<AnimatedShow>` component is an extension for the `<Show>` component and it will not take in a fallback, but it will unmount the component from the DOM after a given duration. This makes it possible to have really easy unmount animations with just
CSS.

## Getting Started

See the [Examples README](../README.md) for setup and run instructions.
