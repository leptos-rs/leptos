# `<AnimatedShow>` combined with CSS animations

This is a very simple example of the `<AnimatedShow>` component.

This component is an extension for the `<Show>` component and it will not take in a fallback, but it will unmount the
component from the DOM after a given duration. This makes it possible to have really easy unmount animations with just
CSS.

Just execute `trunk serve` to start the demo.
