# Leptos Counters Example on Rust Stable

This example showcases a basic Leptos app with many counters. It is a good example of how to setup a basic reactive app with signals and effects, and how to interact with browser events. Unlike the other counters example, it will compile on Rust stable, because it has the `stable` feature enabled.

## Getting Started

See the [Examples README](../README.md) for setup and run instructions.

## Quick Start

Run `trunk serve --open` to run this example.
