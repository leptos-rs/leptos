# Leptos Counters Example on Rust Stable

This example showcases a basic Leptos app with many counters. It is a good example of how to setup a basic reactive app with signals and effects, and how to interact with browser events. Unlike the other counters example, it will compile on Rust stable, because it has the `stable` feature enabled.

## Client Side Rendering

To run it as a client-side app, you can issue `trunk serve --open` in the root. This will build the entire app into one CSR bundle.
