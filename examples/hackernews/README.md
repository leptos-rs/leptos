# Leptos Hacker News Example

This example creates a basic clone of the Hacker News site. It showcases Leptos' ability to create both a client-side rendered app, and a server side rendered app with hydration, in a single repository

## Getting Started

See the [Examples README](../README.md) for setup and run instructions.

For a real-world example see [lemmy-ui-leptos](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui-leptos), which was based on this HN example.
