# Parent Child Example

This example highlights four different ways that child components can communicate with their parent:

1. `<ButtonA/>`: passing a WriteSignal as one of the child component props,
   for the child component to write into and the parent to read
2. `<ButtonB/>`: passing a closure as one of the child component props, for
   the child component to call
3. `<ButtonC/>`: adding a simple event listener on the child component itself
4. `<ButtonD/>`: providing a context that is used in the component (rather than prop drilling)

## Client Side Rendering

To run it as a Client Side App, you can issue `trunk serve --open` in the root. This will build the entire
app into one CSR bundle
