/// # Application profiles
///
/// We use the concept of application profiles to allow for
/// different configuration values depending on the type of environment
/// the application is running in.
///
/// We don't rely on `figment`'s built-in support for profiles because
/// we want to make sure that values for different profiles are not co-located in
/// the same configuration file.
/// This makes it easier to avoid leaking sensitive information by mistake (e.g.
/// by committing configuration values for the `dev` profile to the repository).
///
/// You primary mechanism to specify the desired application profile is the `APP_PROFILE`
/// environment variable.
/// You can pass a `default_profile` value that will be used if the environment variable
/// is not set.
///
/// # Hierarchy
///
/// The configuration sources are:
///
/// 1. `base.yml` - Contains the default configuration values, common to all profiles.
/// 2. `<profile>.yml` - Contains the configuration values specific to the desired profile.
/// 3. Environment variables - Contains the configuration values specific to the current environment.
///
/// The configuration sources are listed in priority order, i.e.
/// the last source in the list will override any previous source.
///
/// For example, if the same configuration key is defined in both
/// the YAML file and the environment, the value from the environment
/// will be used.
