    /// On IPv6 sockets, IPV6_V6ONLY is enabled by default and can't be configured otherwise.
    ///
    /// This function does not require a network capability handle. This is considered to be safe because
    /// at time of creation, the socket is not bound to any `network` yet. Up to the moment `bind`/`connect`
    /// is called, the socket is effectively an in-memory configuration object, unable to communicate with the outside world.
    ///
    /// All sockets are non-blocking. Use the wasi-poll interface to block on asynchronous operations.
    ///
    /// # Typical errors
    /// - `not-supported`:     The specified `address-family` is not supported. (EAFNOSUPPORT)
    /// - `new-socket-limit`:  The new socket resource could not be created because of a system limit. (EMFILE, ENFILE)
