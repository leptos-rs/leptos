# Leptos Authenticated Todo App Sqlite with Axum

This example creates a basic todo app with an Axum backend that uses Leptos' server functions to call sqlx from the client and seamlessly run it on the server. It lets you login, signup, and submit todos as different users, or a guest.

## Getting Started

See the [Examples README](../README.md) for setup and run instructions.

## Quick Start

Run `cargo leptos watch` to run this example.
