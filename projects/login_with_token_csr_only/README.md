# Leptos Login Example

This example demonstrates a scenario of a client-side rendered application
that uses an existing API that you cannot or do not want to change.
The authentications of this example are done using an API token.

The `api-boundary` crate contains data structures that are used by the server and the client.

## Getting Started

See the [Examples README](../README.md) for setup and run instructions.

You will also need to run `cargo make stop` to end the server process.
