# Leptos Axum Starter Template

This is a template for use with the [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) web framework and the [cargo-leptos](https://github.com/akesson/cargo-leptos) tool using [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).

## Creating your template repo

If you don't have `cargo-leptos` installed you can install it with

```bash
cargo install cargo-leptos
```

Then run
```bash
cargo leptos new --git leptos-rs/start-axum
```

to generate a new project template.

```bash
cd app-2
```

to go to your newly created project.  
Feel free to explore the project structure, but the best place to start with your application code is in `src/app.rs`.  
Addtionally, Cargo.toml may need updating as new versions of the dependencies are released, especially if things are not working after a `cargo update`.

## Running your project

```bash
cargo leptos watch
```

## Installing Additional Tools

By default, `cargo-leptos` uses `nightly` Rust, `cargo-generate`, and `sass`. If you run into any trouble, you may need to install one or more of these tools.

1. `rustup toolchain install nightly --allow-downgrade` - make sure you have Rust nightly
2. `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` - add the ability to compile Rust to WebAssembly
3. `cargo install cargo-generate` - install `cargo-generate` binary (should be installed automatically in future)
4. `npm install -g sass` - install `dart-sass` (should be optional in future

## Compiling for Release
```bash
cargo leptos build --release
```

Will generate your server binary in target/server/release and your site package in target/site

## Testing Your Project
```bash
cargo leptos end-to-end
```

```bash
cargo leptos end-to-end --release
```

Cargo-leptos uses Playwright as the end-to-end test tool.  
Tests are located in end2end/tests directory.

## Executing a Server on a Remote Machine Without the Toolchain
After running a `cargo leptos build --release` the minimum files needed are:

1. The server binary located in `target/server/release`
2. The `site` directory and all files within located in `target/site`

Copy these files to your remote server. The directory structure should be:
```text
app-2
site/
```
Set the following environment variables (updating for your project as needed):
```text
LEPTOS_OUTPUT_NAME="app-2"
LEPTOS_SITE_ROOT="site"
LEPTOS_SITE_PKG_DIR="pkg"
LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR="127.0.0.1:3000"
LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT="3001"
```
Finally, run the server binary.
