# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a suspected security issue, please contact security@leptos.dev rather than opening
a public issue.

## Supported Versions

The most-recently-released version of the library is supported with security updates.
For example, if a security issue is discovered that affects 0.3.2 and all later releases,
a 0.4.x patch will be released but a new 0.3.x patch release will not be made. You should 
plan to update to the latest version to receive any new features or bugfixes of any kind.
