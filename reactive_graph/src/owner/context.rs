///
/// Context works similarly to variable scope: a context that is provided higher in

/// distinct type.
///
/// Providing a second value of the same type "lower" in the ownership tree will shadow the value,
/// just as a second `let` declaration with the same variable name will shadow that variable.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use reactive_graph::prelude::*;
/// # use reactive_graph::owner::*;
/// # use reactive_graph::effect::Effect;
/// # futures::executor::block_on(async move {
/// # any_spawner::Executor::init_futures_executor();
/// Effect::new(move |_| {
///     println!("Provider");
///     provide_context("foo"); // provide a &'static str
///
///     Effect::new(move |_| {
///         // before we provide another value of the same type, we can access the old one
///         assert_eq!(use_context::<&'static str>(), Some("foo"));
///         // but providing another value of the same type shadows it
///         provide_context("bar");
///
///         Effect::new(move |_| {
///             assert_eq!(use_context::<&'static str>(), Some("bar"));
///         });
