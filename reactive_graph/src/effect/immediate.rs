/// Effects run a certain chunk of code whenever the signals they depend on change.
///
/// The effect runs on creation and again as soon as any tracked signal changes.
///
/// NOTE: you probably want use [`Effect`](super::Effect) instead.
/// This is for the few cases where it's important to execute effects immediately and in order.
///
/// [ImmediateEffect]s stop running when dropped.
///
/// NOTE: since effects are executed immediately, they might recurse.
/// Under recursion or parallelism only the last run to start is tracked.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```
/// # use reactive_graph::computed::*;
/// # use reactive_graph::signal::*; let owner = reactive_graph::owner::Owner::new(); owner.set();
/// # use reactive_graph::prelude::*;
/// # use reactive_graph::effect::ImmediateEffect;
/// # use reactive_graph::owner::ArenaItem;
/// # let owner = reactive_graph::owner::Owner::new(); owner.set();
/// let a = RwSignal::new(0);
/// let b = RwSignal::new(0);
///
/// // ✅ use effects to interact between reactive state and the outside world
/// let _drop_guard = ImmediateEffect::new(move || {
///   // on the next “tick” prints "Value: 0" and subscribes to `a`
///   println!("Value: {}", a.get());
/// });
///
/// // The effect runs immediately and subscribes to `a`, in the process it prints "Value: 0"
/// # assert_eq!(a.get(), 0);
/// a.set(1);
/// # assert_eq!(a.get(), 1);
/// // ✅ because it's subscribed to `a`, the effect reruns and prints "Value: 1"
/// ```
/// ## Notes
///
/// 1. **Scheduling**: Effects run immediately, as soon as any tracked signal changes.
/// 2. By default, effects do not run unless the `effects` feature is enabled. If you are using
///    this with a web framework, this generally means that effects **do not run on the server**.
///    and you can call browser-specific APIs within the effect function without causing issues.
///    If you need an effect to run on the server, use [`ImmediateEffect::new_isomorphic`].
