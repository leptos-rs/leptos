# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

_This Code of Conduct is based on the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)
and the [Bevy Code of Conduct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bevyengine/bevy/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
which are adapted from the [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling)
and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)._

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

We are a community of people learning and exploring how to build better web applications
with Rust. When interacting with one another, please remember that there are no experts and there are
no stupid questions. Assume the best in other people's communication, and take a step back if
you find yourself getting defensive.

Please note the following guidelines as well:

* Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term “harassment” as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact the maintainers immediately. Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.
* Do not make casual mention of slavery or indentured servitude and/or false comparisons of one's occupation or situation to slavery. Please consider using or asking about alternate terminology when referring to such metaphors in technology.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding [our community’s standards of conduct](#our-standards). If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the maintainers.

1. Remarks that violate the community standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner).
2. Remarks that maintainers find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Maintainers will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be “kicked,” i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Maintainers may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a maintainer bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that maintainer, or with a different maintainer, in private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
8. Maintainers are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a maintainer creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

The enforcement policies in the code of conduct apply to all official venues, including Discord channels, GitHub repositories, and all other forums.
