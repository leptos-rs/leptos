# Feature Safety CI
#
# Verifies that mutually exclusive feature combinations are properly guarded
# and that tachys works correctly regardless of which features are active.
#
# This catches regressions of the SSR feature unification bug where
# cfg!(feature = "ssr") conditionally created event/directive/property values,
# causing silent runtime panics in CSR apps.
